Vulnerability-Assessment-Lab

Project Description:

Established and configured a Windows virtual machine (VM) using VirtualBox to create a secure and controlled environment for comprehensive testing and analysis. This project focuses on enhancing cybersecurity measures through proactive vulnerability assessment and remediation.

Key Activities:

Setting up the Environment:

Implemented a Windows VM on VirtualBox with stringent security configurations to ensure isolation and safeguard against potential threats.
Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Integration:

Installed and configured Nessus vulnerability scanner within the Windows VM, empowering detailed vulnerability assessment and analysis.
Comprehensive Vulnerability Scans:

Conducted thorough vulnerability scans using Nessus, incorporating credential scans to identify and evaluate potential security risks and weaknesses within the system.
Real-world Scenario Simulations:

Deliberately installed vulnerable software within the VM to replicate real-world scenarios, facilitating the evaluation of security defenses and response mechanisms.
Analysis and Remediation:

Identified and analyzed vulnerabilities discovered during scans, enabling a deeper understanding of system weaknesses and potential attack vectors.
Developed and implemented effective remediation strategies to address identified vulnerabilities, thereby minimizing potential risks and enhancing system resilience against cyber threats.
This project exemplifies a proactive approach towards cybersecurity, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring, analysis, and remediation to fortify organizational defenses against evolving threats. Through meticulous testing and strategic intervention, it aims to elevate the overall security posture of the system, ensuring robust protection against potential exploits and vulnerabilities.
